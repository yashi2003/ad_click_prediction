# Ad click Prediction
We have an advertising dataset of a marketing agency. Goal is to develop a ML
algorithm that predicts if a particular user will click on an advertisement. The dataset
has 10 features:


&#39;Daily Time Spent on Site&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;, &#39;Area Income&#39;, &#39;Daily Internet Usage&#39;, &#39;Ad Topic
Line&#39;, &#39;City&#39;, &#39;Country&#39;, Timestamp&#39; &#39;Clicked on Ad&#39; &#39;Male&#39;.


&#39;Clicked on Ad&#39; is the categorical target feature, which has two possible values: 0
(user didn&#39;t click) and 1(user clicked).


# Why is Ad click important ?
A company wants to know the CTR ( Click Through Rate ) in order to identify
whether spending their money on digital advertising is worth it or not.


A higher CTR indicates greater interest in a campaign, while a lower CTR
suggests the ad may be less relevant. High CTRs are beneficial because they lead
to more website traffic and can improve ad positioning at a lower cost on platforms
like Google and Bing.
