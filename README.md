# Ad click Prediction
We have an advertising dataset of a marketing agency. Goal is to develop a ML
algorithm that predicts if a particular user will click on an advertisement. The dataset
has 9 features:
&#39;Daily Time Spent on Site&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;, &#39;Area Income&#39;, &#39;Daily Internet Usage&#39;, &#39;Ad Topic
Line&#39;, &#39;City&#39;, &#39;Country&#39;, Timestamp&#39; &#39;Clicked on Ad&#39;.
&#39;Clicked on Ad&#39; is the categorical target feature, which has two possible values: 0
(user didn&#39;t click) and 1(user clicked).
